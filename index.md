# About Me

<img src="https://KeJin981129.github.io/kejin.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">



Hi 👋 My name is **Jin Ke (柯晋)**.

I am currently a Master's candidate in **Population, Resources & Environmental Economics** at [South China Normal University](https://www.scnu.edu.cn/)(China).

My research interests are divided into three areas at the master's level: 

(1) In the area of macro-demographic economics, I focused on the impact of the digital economy on the demographic dividend and social security. 

(2) In the area of micro-demographic/health economics, I focused on the fertility behavior of the self-employed and assessed the impact of the Chinese long-term care insurance pilot program on multidimensional poverty among middle-aged and older adults. 

(3) In the area of environmental economics, I have focused on the application of the computable general equilibrium model. I am presently leading a study to assess the environmental benefits of foreign direct investment in the clean energy sector in China. 

In addition, at the intersection of environmental economics and health economics, I am currently leading a study to assess the public health benefits of a low-carbon city pilot program in China. 

Here is [my latest CV](http://KeJin981129.github.io/file/CV-kejin.pdf).

## Previous training & Research experiences

My previous training and research experiences have prepared me well for my proposed PhD studies. I have taken three courses in statistics, including a course in demography, and have been trained in the data analysis training program of the Chinese Population Association, which has enabled me to independently apply basic quantitative methods to my research, as demonstrated in my publications. I have been following the development of frontier causal inference techniques and have applied some new methods in my research. For example, a multi-period difference in differences method was used to assess the impact of the Chinese long-term care insurance program on multidimensional poverty among middle-aged and older adults in a quasi-natural experimental framework, and test procedures were designed to test the robustness of the findings. Additionally, I am also interested in using machine learning and natural language processing techniques for quantitative research in the social sciences, and have been actively learning Python on my own, but have not yet used these methods in my research.
