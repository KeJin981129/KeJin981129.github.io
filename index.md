# About Me

<img src="https://KeJin981129.github.io/kejin.jpg" class="floatpic" width="360" height="480">



Hi üëã My name is **Jin Ke (ÊüØÊôã)**.

I am currently a Master's candidate in **Population, Resources & Environmental Economics** at [South China Normal University](https://www.scnu.edu.cn/)(China).

My research interests are divided into three areas at the master's level: 

(1) In the area of macro-demographic economics, I focused on the impact of the digital economy on the demographic dividend and social security. 

(2) In the area of micro-demographic/health economics, I focused on the fertility behavior of the self-employed and assessed the impact of the Chinese long-term care insurance pilot program on multidimensional poverty among middle-aged and older adults. 

(3) In the area of environmental economics, I have focused on the application of the computable general equilibrium model. I am presently leading a study to assess the environmental benefits of foreign direct investment in the clean energy sector in China. In addition, at the intersection of environmental economics and health economics, I am currently leading a study to assess the public health benefits of a low-carbon city pilot program in China. 

Here is [my latest CV](http://KeJin981129.github.io/file/CV-Jinke.pdf).

## Research Interests

My current research focuses on practical problems that artificial intelligence faces in real life. My interests are on the **Machine Learning** and its applications in **Industrial IoT and Healthcare IoT**. In a word, advanced technologies like ML and IoT positively influence the life of everybody.  I wish to devote my talent to this meaningful cause and bring well-being to society.
